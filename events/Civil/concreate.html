<h6>Purpose</h6>

<li>The purpose of this design guide is to give the participants guidance on how to design their Tower-Crane, and insight into the philosophy of both the challenge and the rules. This design guide is also used to clarify the rules.
<h6>Challenge Philosophy </h6>
<li>The main purpose of this challenge is to encourage students to look at the technology that surrounds them and to encourage them to attempt to understand the underlying principles. To build Tower-Crane, some of the most important are: strength of materials, forces and moments in equilibrium, moment of inertia, truss members and how to use them to our advantage for building Tower-Crane structures. The mathematics and science may be beyond complete understanding, but a basic introduction to the principles can be used as an introduction to engineering and physical sciences and to capture their intellectual curiosity.</li>
<li>The organizers of this contest feel that every student group that successfully meets the design criteria of this challenge has successfully met the challenge and will be awarded a certificate of completion.</li>

<h6>Interpretation of rules</h6>
<li>The straws are to be the primary structural component. They should be used to build the structures for Tower-Crane. Pins are the only material to help the straws do their job.</li>

<h6>Materials</h6>
<li>The straws used here have 0.5cm diameter and 20cm long. These would commonly be described as a regular drinking straw. Each group would have to complete their structure with the help of 150 straws only. Moreover, pins would be available in required quantity form contest coordinator. If you have any shortages or questions please contact contest coordinator. Under no circumstances materials brought by participants will be accepted as construction material. Tools required for cutting should be brought by participants.</li>

<h6>Joints</h6>
<li>The pins are the only material allowed for joints. Joints are critical to the proper construction. While pins are necessary to the construction of the joints, excess pins does not add strength but does add weight. </li><br />

	</ul>
	</div>
<div id="rule">
<ol>
<li>	Each team would consist of maximum 3 participants and the time provided to complete the task is 3 hours.</li>

<li>Each team will have to construct according to dimensions provided in specification chart, violation of any kind would lead to disqualification of the team.</li>

<li>The tower section of the crane would have to be kept directly on the working table, without any kind of support or fixture.</li>

<li>Only straws and pins will be allowed during entire construction, no string or any other materials would be allowed even for suspension.</li>

<li>Tools required for cutting are to be brought by participants.</li>

<li>All the three sections i.e., boom section, counter section and tower section should be hollow at middle part. These sections can be of any shape, but should be satisfying the specification criteria.</li>

<li>For each team same counter weight will be applied on counter section of the crane.  Moreover, the suspension of the weight will be done at the tip of boom section with predetermined method.  </li>

<li>Final decision will be authorized by the event judges.</li>

<li>At any time these rules can be updated, without any prior notice</li>
</ol>
<h6> Winner Criteria</h6>
<ol>
<li>The first criteria is the stability of the structure i.e., tower-crane should not fall under ideal condition. Moreover it should be according to specified dimensions. The stability will be checked without applying any kind of weight to the crane. If team attains this criteria than only it would be allowed to proceed towards second criteria, else the team would be disqualified.</li>

<li>According to second criteria, the load would be suspended at tip of boom section against the counter weight. The team possessing maximum Test for Efficiency ratio before self destruction of the Tower-Crane would be declared as winner.	</li>
