<li>As each day passes by, we are moving towards a potential fuel crisis. With the traditional fuels getting close to exhaustion, the world needs to do all it can to take advantage of renewable energy sources. Alternatively, we can conserve energy through various methods for energy management and effective designing of homes can be one such method. A simple design can change how we live and how our future will be.</li>
<li>Hence, the task is to design an eco friendly, energy conserving and low maintenance house.</li>

<h6>Specifications</h6>
<li>The house is to be built at an open space on a plot area of 2500 sq. ft. The plot should be rectangular in shape (i.e. the length should be (1.2 to 1.5) times the width of house).</li>
<li>The planning should be done in compliance with building bye-laws as per AMC or AUDA.</li>
<li>The participant should plan considering the energy efficient design, principles of building science, construction materials used and indoor air quality.</li>
<h6>The following will be required on the day of event:</h6>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Participants are required to submit the site plan, plan (at all levels) and elevation inseparate sheets. 
<li>Software like AutoCAD shall be used for the same. Please inform us beforehand about the software that you would be using for the final presentation.
<li>Documentation for overall energy reduction: Teams are required to give a rough estimate of reduction in energy requirements achieved through their design. An exact quantitative description of the net energy reduction is not needed.
<li>Participants will have to make a presentation before a panel of judges explaining how they have made their building energy efficient and how their methods can be practically implemented.
<br>
<li>articipants should also bring the hard copy, containing description about following:
<li>A brief overview of the design.
<li>Material used for construction.
<li>Number of floors your house would have and how you have optimized that.
<li>Placement of the various rooms and areas in the design, depending upon the kind of conditions they need.
<li>Description of the energy efficient methods used; in this section include the areas where you
<li>feel that energy consumption of the building can be reduced and mention all the measures taken to do the same.


<h6>Judging Criteria</h6>
<li>Your innovation and understanding of the design will result in more marks being awarded to you. Following are some of the parameters on which the design will be judged
<li>Overall Planning skill
<li>How well is green building concept implemented
<li>Presentation Skills

<li>Each team would consist of maximum 3 participants and time allotted per team to complete the presentation would be maximum of 10 minutes.
<li>Multiple entries are not allowed.
<li>Final decision will be authorized by event judges and shall be binding to all.
<li>At any time these rules can be updated, without any prior notice.
