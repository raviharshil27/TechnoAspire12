<li>Cryptomania is about cryptogram puzzles. Mainly concern on data
security using Encryption and Decryption algorithms. It will help you
to secure your informationâ€™s confidentiality and integration.This
algorithms will help you to understand the original information which
will be coded in unintelligible format.Through this algorithms,one can
decrypt the code and can get the original information over the
network.
Its time to Reveal the unrevealed, and vice versa!

<ul>
Puzzle Round:<br>
<li>In this round, some set of puzzles will be given to the participants in group.
<li>There are total 25 questions will be given to them. The correct answer will get 2 marks each and wrong will be considered as negative 1 mark each.
<li>Time Limit: 40 minutes<br>
</ul>
<ul>
Decryption :<br>
<li>In this round, the group candidates will have some coded message made by encryption methods.
<li>They will get brief guidance about those methods.
<br>After having proper guidance, they have to decode the message and they also have to identify which method has been used for decryption of message.
<br>Some helpful hints will also be given to them for sake of simplicity and reliability.
<br>
Time Limit: 30 minutes
</ul>
<ul>
Group War :<br>
<li>This is last round of this event.
<li>The Groups which will be selected after passing from two rounds have to prepare some encrypted message using any method earlier guided.
<li>Each and every group have to prepare some message having minimum of 6 and maximum no. of 10 lines.
<li>This message will be given to other group for decryption. They have to decrypt it in some specific time limit.<br>
Time Limit:<br>
Message preparation: 15 minutes<br>
Message Decryption: 15 minutes<br>
<b>Some Important Notes:</b>
<ul>
<li>Time criteria will be considered in each and every round in case of Tie between two or more groups.
<li>Minimum no. of participants in group : 1
<li> Maximum no. of participants in group : 3
