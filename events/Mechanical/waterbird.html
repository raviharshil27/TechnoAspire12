<li>Space missions have always fascinated humankind and Rockets have been the integral element of those fantasies. But just imagine if you could build your own rocket with some simple materials like water.</li>
<li>Techno Aspire 2012 presents you an all-new competition of water rocketry:  where you have to build your rocket with easily available materials and power it with Water and Air. No need to have knowledge of complex Aeronautical engineering. Just let your creativity set free and explore the world of rockets.
Remember, This is not Rocket Science!!</li>

<ul>
<h6>Round-1 </h6>
<li>	Participants have to make a water rocket</li>
<li>	The rocket which succeed to cross the barrier of 35 m will get qualified to the next round</li>
<h6>Round-2</h6>
<li>	Round-2 rules will be given on the spot.</li>
<br/>
<h6>EVENT DETAILS </h6>
<li>	The event will get started at 10:00 a.m. on the first day of techno aspireâ€™12.So the participants are requested to reach on the event place before time to avoid team disqualification.</li>
<li>	What you have to do is just to make a model of rocket which can be made by using 2-litre(minimum 1.5 liter) soda bottle(pepsi,thumbs-up,limca,fanta only)</li>
<li>	The launcher mechanism will be provided by us.</li>
<li>	Participants can bring their own bottle, though bottle will be provided on the spot in case of any team not having the bottle.( rupees 20/- will be charged for a bottle. so it would be better to bring your own bottle)
<li>	Pressurized water will only be used for energizing the bottle.</li>
<li>	Water will also be provided.</li>
<li>	Participants will just have to make a bottle aerodynamically stable and adjust the centre of mass accordingly and to decide the amount of water to be filled into bottle.</li>
<li>	Time of around 3 hours will be given to each team for making the bottle rocket </li>
<li>	PARTICIPANTS CAN MAKE THE BOTTLE ROCKET (USING THEIR OWN DESIGN CONCEPTS AND MATERIALS) BEFORE THE EVENT. IT REQUIRES PRE-REGISTERING FOR THE EVENT ONLY.ON THE SPOT REGISTRATION IS ALLOWED THOUGH.</li>
<li>	WE ADVISE YOU TO GO THROUGH THE RESEARCH ON AERODYNAMICS CONCEPTS AND VARIOUS VIDEOS AND INFORMATION ON BOTTLE ROCKET. </li>
<li>	IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO USE MATERIAL WE PROVIDE. BRINGING YOUR OWN BOTTLE ROCKET IS ALLOWED.  </li>
<li>	The materials which can be used for making bottle aerodynamics are listed below</li>
<ol>
<li>Cardboard</li>
<li>Glue</li>
<li>Tapes </li>
<li>Scissors,etc</li>
</ol>
<li>	Teams must have their own materials for making bottle aerodynamics.</li>
<li>	The maximum pressure should not exceed 60 psi[4.2 bar approx.]</li>
<li>	PROPER GUIDENCE WILL BE GIVEN FOR MAKING THE ROCKET. SO THE EVENT IS KIND OF A WATER ROCKET MODEL MAKING WORKSHOP.</li>
<li>	Participants can bring their own air pump, though the pumps will be provided on the spot.</li>
<li>	The Pump is nothing but the air pump which is usually being used for filling the air into the cycle tyre tubes.</li>
<li>	After all the teams complete the task of constructing bottle aerodynamics, all the teams will have to submit their bottle and one-by-one we will fix the bottle to the launcher and the bottle rocket which covers maximum horizontal distance ,the respected team will be announced as a winner.</li>
<li>	This will be an on the spot event or participants can pre-register to it.</li>
<li>	Just go through the images that has been attached</li>
<li ><a href="../../images/event_photos/water_1.gif" style="color:#F00" target="_blank">photo-1</a> &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../../images/event_photos/water_2.png" style="color:#F00" target="_blank">photo-2</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../images/event_photos/water_3.jpg" target="_blank" style="color:#F00">photo-3</a></li>
<li>	It is not necessary to make the same models as shown in figure. You can apply your own design</li>
<li>Check out the website regularly in case of any updates regarding this events.</li>
<h6>TEAM SPECIFICATIONS </h6>
<li>	A team must have minimum 1 member and maximum 3 members</li>
<li>Students from different colleges can make a team</li>
