an array of acts with socially relevant messages from those "olden days".<br>
Authentic plays aiming at the common man passing by on the street are displayed with three Es: Excitement, Energy and Enthusiasm<br>
A tinge of imagination, shade of reality and desire to express social awareness is what NUKKAD-NATAK is all about.<br>
It is more powerful than any other mode of theater because of its proximity between the audience and actors.
