MULTISIM :<br>
Multisim is software through which you can build up circuits virtually, simulate it and also can find out the graph of relationship between any two quantities related with the circuit. Also it provides you capability to design multilayer chip and rout it.<br>
SHEDULE:<br><ul>
<li>It will be two days event. On the first day there will be workshop and first round of competition.
<li>And on the second day there will be semi-final and final round of competition.
<li>No. of hours need :</ul><ol>
<li>For workshop : 4-5 hours
<li>For first round of competition : 1 hour
<li>For semi-final round : 2 hours
<li>For final round : 3 hours
</ol>

ELIMINATION METHOD:<ol>
<li>In the first round candidates should find out the components and place it on the screen. The list of components will be given by event manager.
<li>In the second round candidates should built up the circuit and simulate it to get proper output as per the circuit given to them. (Circuit designing should be done by candidates.)
<li>In the final round candidates should make the whole circuit (just as some system) and built up virtually it on the single layer PCB. And should get 3D view of it.
</ol><ul>
<li>Hence at the end of whole competition candidates will be capable to build up circuits virtually, simulate it, also can do analysis and can make routing path for their PCB.
<li>So, the aim of our workshop will be satisfied to teach the candidates MULTISIM and to make them capable to apply it in their future study and project.</ul>
Note: <br>
Method for rounds can be changed by event manager in any influence. And for any conflicts last decision will be of event manager. Under the terms of any dispute, decision of the event manager will be final. The organizers reserve the right to change any or all of the rules, if they consider necessary. The changes will be notified.<br>
