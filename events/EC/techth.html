If the latest media reports are to be believed, the infamous Somali Pirates attempted an attack on MV Bharat which reportedly contained the Peacock Throne of Shah Jahan. The report further adds that the latest recruit in the pirate herd was a distressed Electronics Engineer (IIT B alumni) who was assigned the task of safe-keeping the treasure. The world attention is now fixated on India who is desperate to bring the glorious treasure back. This is where your technical skills can assist us.  <br>

Expected Skills :- Fundamentals of Digital Electronics, Basic Electronics, Circuit Theory, some other technical know-how.<br>

Team Size ≤ 3<br>

Round 1: <br>

The participants will be given a crossword based on the above and are expected to solve it in the least possible time. Based on its result they will have to pursue other clue.<br>

Round 2:<br>

The format of this round would be declared on the day of the event.<br>

The decision of the event coordinator would be deemed final and binding to all participants.<br>

PS – Some of the above is purely fictional. Obviously, the Indian Navy would have intercepted the pirates before they ran away with the treasure!<br>
